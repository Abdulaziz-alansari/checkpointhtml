        engaged in the design, development, manufacturing, and worldwide marketing and sales of footwear, apparel, equipment,
        accessories, and services. The company is headquartered near Beaverton, Oregon, in the Portland metropolitan area.[3] It
        is the world's largest supplier of athletic shoes and apparel and a major manufacturer of sports equipment, with revenue
        in excess of US$37.4 billion in its fiscal year 2020 (ending May 31, 2020).[4] As of 2020, it employed 76,700 people

        Fortune 500 list of the largest United States corporations by total revenue.[8]

        The company was founded on January 25, 1964, as "Blue Ribbon Sports", by Bill Bowerman and Phil Knight, and officially

      <h1>ADIDAS</h1>


        <div>
          <img src="images addida.png" alt="projet1">
          <p>Adidas AG (German: [ˈʔadiˌdas]; stylized as adidas since 1949)[4] is a German multinational corporation, founded and
          headquartered in Herzogenaurach, Bavaria, that designs and manufactures shoes, clothing and accessories. It is the
          largest sportswear manufacturer in Europe, and the second largest in the world, after Nike.[5][6] It is the holding
          company for the Adidas Group, which consists of the Reebok sportswear company, 8.33% of the German football club Bayern
          München,[7] and Runtastic, an Austrian fitness technology company. Adidas' revenue for 2018 was listed at €21.915
          billion.[3]

          The company was started by Adolf Dassler in his mother's house; he was joined by his elder brother Rudolf in 1924 under
          the name Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik ("Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory"). Dassler assisted in the development of spiked
          running shoes (spikes) for multiple athletic events. To enhance the quality of spiked athletic footwear, he transitioned
          from a previous model of heavy metal spikes to utilising canvas and rubber. Dassler persuaded U.S. sprinter Jesse Owens
          to use his handmade spikes at the 1936 Summer Olympics. In 1949, following a breakdown in the relationship between the
          brothers, Adolf created Adidas, and Rudolf established Puma, which became Adidas' business rival.[1]

          The three stripes are Adidas' identity mark, having been used on the company's clothing and shoe designs as a marketing
          aid. The branding, which Adidas bought in 1952 from Finnish sports company Karhu Sports for the equivalent of €1,600 and
          two bottles of whiskey,[8][9] became so successful that Dassler described Adidas as "The three stripes company".[8][10]</p>

      <h1>PUMA</h1>

      <div>
        <img src="PUMA.jpeg" alt="projet1">
        <p>Puma SE, branded as Puma, is a German multinational corporation that designs and manufactures athletic and casual
        footwear, apparel and accessories, which is headquartered in Herzogenaurach, Bavaria, Germany. Puma is the third largest
        sportswear manufacturer in the world.[5] The company was founded in 1948 by Rudolf Dassler. In 1924, Rudolf and his
        brother Adolf "Adi" Dassler had jointly formed the company Gebrüder Dassler Schuhfabrik (Dassler Brothers Shoe Factory).
        The relationship between the two brothers deteriorated until the two agreed to split in 1948, forming two separate
        entities, Adidas and Puma. Both companies are currently based in Herzogenaurach, Germany.

        Puma has been a public company since 1986, listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange. French luxury group Kering (formerly
        known as PPR) holds 9,8%, Kering's largest shareholder Groupe Artemis owns 29% of the share capital.[6] Since 1 July
        2013, the company has been led by former football professional Bjørn Gulden (chief executive officer).

        As of 2017, Puma SE employs more than 13,000 people worldwide and distributes its products in more than 120
        countries.[7][8]

        Following the split from his brother, Rudolf originally registered the newly established company as Ruda (derived from
        Rudolf Dassler, as Adidas was based on Adi Dassler), but later changed the name to Puma.[9] Puma's earliest logo
        consisted of a square and beast jumping through a D, which was registered, along with the company's name, in 1948.
        Puma's shoe and clothing designs feature the Puma logo and the distinctive "Formstrip" which was introduced in 1958.[10]</p>
